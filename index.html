      <div class=box>
          <p>The day we met was the start of the best time I've had in my entire life. We made a commitment when we made things offical at the Christmas Festival a little over a year and a half ago, a commitment you've honored and I intend to continue to honor until the day I die. I love you with my whole heart, and even though I can seem distant, and we've both had our fair share of issue, I love you. Even when we were broken up, I tried to imagine a future with anybody else, or even just myself, and I couldn't. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, or not spend it at all, because you give value to every little thing in life, I'm full of so much hate and anger sometimes, yet you're the one person I could never hate. Because of you, I get to spend every second of my life from now on with the knowledge that someone loves me, you made me feel worth caring about, and you will always hold the most special place in my heart. (don't show anyone I know this they're gonna call me goofy) Love you, Your Husband</p>
